    "3. Any open ended questions will have a \"YOUR ANSWER HERE\" within a markdown cell. Replace that text with your answer also formatted using Markdown.\n",
    "4. **DO NOT RENAME THIS NOTEBOOK File!** If the file name changes, the autograder will not grade your assignment properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Only include the package imports, code, and outputs that are required to run your homework assignment.\n",
    "* Be sure that your code can be run on any operating system. This means that:\n",

    "   2. all paths should be created dynamically using the `os.path.join`\n",

    "\n",
    "* Run the `autopep8` tool on all cells prior to submitting (HINT: hit shift + the tool to run it on all cells at once!\n",
    "* Use clear and expressive names for variables. \n",
    "* Organize your code to support readability.\n",
    "* Check for code line length\n",
    "* Use comments and white space sparingly where it is needed\n",

In general, if you are repeatedly downloading the same data (as in hundreds of times close together) it is polite to check in with the hosting service about how the would like you to manage the data downloads. Official APIs usually have  rules about how to use their services, which they enforce through the use of tokens. Try not to abuse the openness of Natural Earth Data by setting up many automatic downloads. For example, geopandas will read directly from the url, which is a nice feature, but it does not cache by default. That's why we're using earthpy, which caches automatically. Another way you could trigger lots of downloads is by running `timeit` on a cell that does the download without caching.\n",
